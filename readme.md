This IS How you all will use it

##Major Definition Changes##
1. Added New Lite Version for keeping it simple for bot to use
2. The lite version is 172 lines only (orignal was 222 lines long)
3. New Heavily Changed Css Under Development (Target 16k+ words)

First of all we need description : 
- WE NEED TO USE CHATGPT FOR IT SO I WILL TEACH HOW
- Ask Chatgpt to make one
- For Example : Generate a description for a 17 year old highschooler bully who is female and her country of origin is Russia and name her as Emily Mikhailovna , She is slim , She is 5'8 in height
- Now it will give you the description so paste it in description tab

##Description Example##
- https://chatgpt.com/share/d4caa0bf-e143-4346-9348-e4bce07daf67 (Includes 2 Different Types And if you see github one it is more preferable)

Now We Need To Make Greeting So for that you can take any of your favourite 
c.ai bot so now you can take any of your favourite bot for example am taking this one - https://character.ai/chat/ELeXzkQ8xJkJV7cfYVwQtS9Z--WKT7BgOnFKYhKxr48

Anyways After you do that you can use my chat gpt chat to review how i did it : https://chatgpt.com/share/7e0e406f-6ffb-4b0a-806e-f763cf85e709
